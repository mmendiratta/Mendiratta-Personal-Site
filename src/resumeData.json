I describe myself as someone who is passionate about learning and trying new things, while also not being afraid to inquire about things I don't understand. I grew up playing sports my whole life such as basketball, soccer, and golf, which has led me to become an avid Minnesota sports fan. I aspire to travel and see as much of the world as I can in my life. ",
